# pacman-simulation

## Description
This project contains an interactive device that allows the user to create as many pacmen as they want. By clicking the start button, the pacmen will move around the container and move their mouths open and closed.

## How To Run
You can run this project directly from my profile page by navigating to dylanavernon.github.io and finding the project on my projects page.

## Future Improvements
A later version of this project will create pacmen with different colors.
